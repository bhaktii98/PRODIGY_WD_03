# PRODIGY_WD_03
This project is a responsive and interactive tic-tac-toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my internship. It features player vs. player and player vs. AI modes. The game handles user clicks, tracks game state, and checks for winning conditions, providing an engaging experience as players aim to get three markers in a row to win.

Features
Player vs. Player: Two players can compete against each other.
Player vs. AI: Play against an AI opponent.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Clean UI: Simple and modern interface for an enjoyable user experience.
Game Logic: Handles user interactions, game state management, and winning condition checks.
